Backend Endpoints vs Frontend Implementation:

MISSING IN FRONTEND:
1. Photo Privacy Toggle - PUT /api/users/photo-privacy
2. Relationship Intent Update - PUT /api/users/relationship-intent  
3. Unread Message Count - GET /api/chat/{match_id}/unread-count
4. User Safety Check - GET /api/safety/user-safety/{user_id}

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:
1. Image Upload - Works but no UI to show uploaded images
2. Image Delete - Backend ready but no delete button in UI
3. Location Update - Helper exists but not integrated in profile
4. Interests Update - Works but could be better

NEED TO ADD:
1. Show uploaded images in profile
2. Delete image button
3. Location permission request on app start
4. Unread message badges
5. Safety indicators on user profiles
6. Photo privacy settings toggle
